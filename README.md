# ETL_based-E-business-analytics
This paper introduces an ETL tool to aid decision-making for upper management and clients by gathering e-business site data from various sources, transforming it into a compatible format for deep learning models. These models compare costs, evaluate products, and offer optimal options for consumers and businesses. Through a dashboard, businesses gain insights into customer preferences, facilitating product improvements and growth. Effective data visualization is achieved using business analytics tools like Tableau or Power BI.
